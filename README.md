# Piano Man Game (Working Title)

It’s a pretty good crowd, for a Saturday. At least it will be, so you better prepare. Play as Bill, a talented piano player who is preparing for his big set at the bar this upcoming weekend. Chat with the lonely patrons of the bar to learn their stories, and connect their conversations to find the memories that they want to hear. They’re all in the mood for a melody, so it’s time to get them feeling alright.
